## üîü User Experience

**Flow of intended usage:**
1. User registers ‚Üí completes profile setup ‚Üí gets to dashboard
2. User adds job applications and tracks status
3. User starts practice sessions (general or job-specific)
4. AI generates personalized questions based on profile/job
5. User answers questions and gets AI feedback
6. Answers are saved in library with tags
7. User can filter/search/organize their answer library

**Tech Stack:**
- React + TypeScript for frontend
- Firebase for database and auth
- OpenAI API for AI features
- Custom PyTorch model for local AI
- Tailwind for styling because we are more familiar with inline styling

## 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started

```bash
# install stuff
npm install

# set up environment variables 

# start the app
npm start

# train custom model using my argparses (optional)
python 7B.py --data_dir ./data
```

## 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Important Data Types

- `UserProfile` - all user info
- `Job` - job application data  
- `Answer` - saved practice answers
- `Question` - interview questions
- `PracticeSession` - practice session info

## Misc stuff
- The AI feedback system uses both OpenAI API and local DeepSeek model
- Resume parsing works with PDF files
- All data is stored in Firebase Firestore
- The app is optimized for mobile and desktop by using carefully designed Tailwind md: and sm: attributes
- Users can practice with job-specific questions or general interview prep

A lot of features are not optimized but we are mainly facing roadblocks in hardware and not technical blockades
